# PROJECT ORACLE — CANONICAL CONTINUATION STATE

Last updated: 2026-11-07 — Manifest compatibility gate closed by direct artifact verification
Governed branch: `research/oracle-50-league-readiness-audit`

## Current objective
Clear the remaining 50-league validation and release gates and reach governed production prediction readiness without changing Oracle V1.6 production logic.

## Acquisition control-plane
- Universe: 50 leagues
- Provider-season partitions: 182
- Governed endpoint tasks: 728
- Current acquisition accounting: 648 completed + 80 HTTP-417 quarantined/provider-blocked + 0 pending = 728
- Exhausted private ingestion run #92 must NOT be rerun merely because it exited red.

## Major milestone — FootyStats manifest compatibility gate CLOSED
Private FootyStats batch `42255401046`:
- 8,367 rows received
- 100 provider requests
- provider-recorded manifest reference field: `57fe9e1184b5035327feaa78307750e129c54bf3`
- manifest file SHA-256: `58bd06ed9c5a6a09ed55eb833319ca09cd4f01e2b175e4ca9127a1b3a7f689d7`
- 100 explicit completed task IDs

Direct artifact verification:
- Manifest fetched at provider reference `57fe9e...` resolves to actual Git blob `6a916c962bfbcad1cfb429e23c26e0aef9b3a611`.
- Manifest fetched from current governed branch resolves to the SAME Git blob `6a916c962bfbcad1cfb429e23c26e0aef9b3a611`.
- Both files are exactly identical: 116,108 bytes.
- Receipt task IDs matched current governed manifest: 100/100.
- Missing receipt task IDs: 0.

Therefore the provider reference value is not an incompatible manifest. The manifest compatibility gate is **CLOSED**. The 100-task receipt is admissible for those exact tasks and remains a subset of the 728-task universe; it is not additional task completion.

## Major milestone — 80 HTTP-417 quarantine mapped
The 80 quarantined tasks are exactly 20 provider-season partitions × 4 endpoints:
- Finland Veikkausliiga: 2024, 2025, 2026
- India Indian Super League: 2023/2024, 2024/2025, 2025/2026, 2026/2027
- Republic of Ireland Premier Division: 2024, 2025, 2026
- Russia Russian Premier League: 2023/2024, 2024/2025, 2025/2026, 2026/2027
- South Korea K League 1: 2024, 2025, 2026
- Venezuela Primera División: 2024, 2025, 2026
Endpoints: `league-matches`, `league-teams`, `league-tables`, `league-season`.

## Validated research/readiness evidence
- Selected-50 Market Intelligence repair #360 is complete.
- 717 runtime fixtures had exact archive joins in that artifact.
- Chronological expanding-window research backtests exist but are research-only.
- Canonical production settlement ledger remains header-only.
- 210 challenger shadow market rows across 42 fixtures are research-only.
- xG numeric values exist, but point-in-time capture timestamps are not verified.
- Timestamped odds provenance is not verified.
- Production/betting eligibility remains false.



## Major milestone — 648 completed-task evidence VERIFIED — 2026-11-07
The governed 648-completed population is now deterministically reconciled against the current 728-task manifest and private blocked registry.

- 11 private completion checkpoints inspected.
- 748 checkpoint rows contained 648 unique completed task IDs; 100 rows were duplicate IDs from repeated runs and were not double-counted.
- Current governed manifest: 728 task IDs.
- Private blocked registry: 80 task IDs.
- Completed ∩ blocked: 0.
- Manifest IDs missing from completed or blocked: 0.
- Completed IDs outside manifest: 0.
- Exact partition: **648 completed + 80 quarantined + 0 pending = 728**.

The 648 evidence gate is CLOSED/VERIFIED. Do not repeat this reconciliation or rerun ingestion to reproduce the count.

## Major milestone — OMI / Visual Intelligence consolidated readiness matrix
Research-only OMI integration consumed the completed Selected-50 Repair #360 artifact without rerunning it or making provider/API calls.
- 717 runtime fixtures; 717/717 exact archive joins; 0 unmatched/quarantined joins; 0 schedule discordance rows.
- 45 selected leagues represented by fixtures; 5 selected leagues have no fixtures in the inspected report horizon and remain UNVERIFIED, not READY.
- Recent overall form: 1,398/1,434 team-side slots at full five-match depth (97.49%).
- Venue/home-away form: 836/1,434 team-side slots at full five-match depth (58.30%).
- Exact H2H: 604/717 fixtures have prior exact H2H history (84.24%); no H2H inference permitted.
- Goal research: 699/717 (97.49%); BTTS: 678/717 (94.56%).
- xG: 717/717 numeric, but 0/717 verified capture timestamps; production admission BLOCKED.
- Odds: timestamped bookmaker/market provenance unavailable in the baseline; BLOCKED.
- Actual settlement: 717/717 rows remain NOT_RETRIEVED_NO_CREDIT_APPROVAL; no production settlement promoted.
- Runtime feature-block audit: 39 fixtures / 40 team-side histories blocked by minimum-history/required-feature gates.
- Risk fields are diagnostic-ready for represented fixtures; confidence/recency and production performance remain UNVERIFIED.
- Per-league matrix: reports/oracle-omi-release-readiness-matrix-2026-11-07.csv
- Checkpoint: docs/checkpoints/2026-11-07-omi-release-readiness-0744.md

OMI decision: production/betting remains FAIL-CLOSED. The next OMI dependency is the canonical prediction/fixture bridge plus immutable pre-kickoff feature snapshot and verified settlement evidence owned by the Evidence/Validation lanes. No production probability is changed or inferred.

## Immediate next work — priority order
1. Reconcile/validate evidence supporting the 648 completed-task population; do not redo manifest work.
2. Determine whether approved private FootyStats recovery can resolve the exact 20 quarantined provider-season partitions without repeating completed tasks or exceeding budget.
3. Build/validate immutable prediction → fixture → pre-kickoff feature snapshot → verified settlement linkage.
4. Close xG and odds point-in-time provenance where evidence permits.
5. Advance OMI/Visual Intelligence/release gates from validated evidence.
6. Keep all production and betting gates fail-closed until genuinely satisfied.

## Do not repeat
- Do not rerun ingestion #92 as a generic full-universe run.
- Do not rerun the disabled protected-repository audit.
- Do not rerun the completed Selected-50 Market Intelligence repair baseline.
- Do not reacquire batch `42255401046`.
- Do not repeat manifest compatibility reconciliation.
- Do not reinterpret research/shadow metrics as production accuracy.
- Do not change Oracle V1.6 production logic, probabilities, thresholds, calibration, betting eligibility or governance.

## Coordination
- Validation lane: 50-league data/readiness and provider-gap reconciliation.
- Evidence lane: prediction/settlement linkage and leakage-safe backtesting.
- OMI lane: consolidated OMI/Visual Intelligence/release reporting.
- All lanes must read this state + lessons, inspect live HEAD, reconcile intervening commits, and checkpoint every major milestone.

## Definition of done
Production prediction readiness requires genuinely satisfied identity, chronology, point-in-time feature provenance, prediction/settlement linkage and required market/league gates. Missing/quarantined evidence remains excluded. Fail-closed remains active until gates pass.
